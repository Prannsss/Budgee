## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) for trustworthiness and clarity.
- Background color: Light teal (#E0F8F8), a very desaturated tint of the primary, creates a clean, calm surface.
- Accent color: Pale cyan (#77D9D9) to draw the eye and highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Montserrat', a grotesque sans-serif that looks contemporary and neutral.
- Use consistent and finance-related icons for different asset types (banks, e-wallets, crypto, etc.).
- Maintain rounded corners, soft shadows, and consistent spacing for a clean and modern look.
- The navbar when on mobile view should be at the bottom and kind of like a rectangle with rounded corners for that elegant feel. And When in mobile I don't want there to be a topbar so that it feels immersive.
- Incorporate subtle animations on loading and when connecting accounts to give a polished feel. Use skeleton loading for other pages.
