# Render Deployment Configuration Fix

## Problem
Render was running `npm install` in production mode, which skips `devDependencies`. TypeScript and @types packages are in devDependencies, causing build failures.

## Solution

### Option 1: Update Render Build Command (RECOMMENDED)
In your Render dashboard, update the **Build Command** to:

```bash
npm install --production=false && npm run build
```

OR

```bash
npm ci --include=dev && npm run build
```

### Option 2: Set Environment Variable
Add this environment variable in Render:

```
NODE_ENV=development
```

Then the build command can stay as:
```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

### Option 3: Move TypeScript to dependencies (NOT RECOMMENDED)
This would bloat production but would work. Only use if other options fail.

## Changes Made in This Fix

1. **Removed explicit `types` array from tsconfig files**
   - TypeScript will now auto-discover type definitions
   - `skipLibCheck: true` in tsconfig.build.json to skip type checking of declaration files

2. **Updated declarations.d.ts**
   - Added manual type declarations for passport-google-oauth20, passport-facebook, and bcryptjs
   - These provide the type definitions when @types packages aren't available

3. **Fixed all implicit any types**
   - Added proper Request, Response types to route handlers
   - Added proper callback types to Passport strategies

## Testing Locally

To simulate Render's build process locally:

```powershell
# Clean build
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules, dist, package-lock.json
npm install --production=false
npm run build
```

## Verification

After updating Render's build command, the deployment should succeed with output like:

```
✓ npm install --production=false
✓ npm run build
✓ Build completed successfully
```
